# Tweets-Data-Analysis
In this project i analyzing Twitter data, specifically tweets from Elon Musk, to gain insights into user engagement, sentiment, and text-based clustering. Here’s an overview of the steps and methodologies i have applied:

Data Collection: Scraping tweets from Elon Musk using the ntscraper library to gather a dataset of 600 tweets. This dataset includes tweet links, text, date, likes, and comments.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the tweet text by performing multiple transformations:

Removing URLs: Any links in the tweets are removed.
Removing Stopwords: Common words that don’t add much meaning (e.g., "and", "the") are eliminated.
Removing Punctuation: Punctuation marks are stripped out.
Handling Repeated Characters: Any repeated characters (e.g., "soooon" → "son") are reduced to a single character.
Removing Numbers: All numeric values are removed from the tweet text.
Sentiment Analysis: Use the VADER sentiment analyzer to assign a sentiment score to each tweet. Based on the compound score, i categorize the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.

Data Visualization:

Likes and Comments: Visualize the total number of likes and comments across all tweets and plot their distributions.
Word Frequency: Generate a bar chart to visualize the most frequent words used in the tweets.
Word Clouds: Create word clouds to visualize words related to different sentiment categories (positive and negative).
Clustering:

K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to the tweet text using TF-IDF vectorization. By evaluating silhouette scores, identify the optimal number of clusters and then assign each tweet to a cluster.
Also print the resulting clusters and the corresponding tweet text.
Feature Engineering:

Introduce new features such as tweet length, average word length, and the ratio of likes to comments to provide additional insights.
Cosine Similarity:

Calculate the cosine similarity between different pairs of tweets to analyze their textual similarity using Spacy embeddings.
Temporal Analysis:

Perform a temporal analysis to track the number of likes and comments over time. This analysis helps identify any temporal trends or patterns in user engagement with the tweets.
Final Output:

The project outputs several visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, word clouds, and time series plots, to provide insights into engagement patterns, sentiment distribution, and textual content of the tweets.
Key Insights:
Sentiment Analysis provides an understanding of the emotional tone of Elon Musk’s tweets.
Clustering groups similar tweets, which can be useful for content categorization or topic modeling.
Cosine Similarity helps identify similar tweets, which might reveal patterns in the type of content being shared.
Temporal Analysis allows for tracking engagement over time, which can help identify specific periods with higher activity or popularity.
This project combines text processing, sentiment analysis, clustering, and time series analysis to provide a comprehensive view of social media interactions, with the specific focus on Elon Musk’s tweets.
